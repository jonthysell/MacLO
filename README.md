# MacLO #

MacLO is a clone of the puzzle game [Lights Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) for the Classic Macintosh.

## Build ##

To build MacLO from source, you'll need a working THINK C 5.0 development environment.

## Play ##

MacLO contains two sets of 50 puzzles.

The objective is to turn off all of the lights in as few moves as possible. Clicking a light will cause it and the nearby lights to toggle in the shape of a plus.

After finshing a puzzle, you'll be given a score in one to three stars. Here you can either move on to the next puzzle or retry for a better score. Try to get three stars on all 50 levels in the set!
